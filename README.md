# FocusUscis2FA
A Chrome extension to make logging into USCIS mildly less irritating.

USCIS frustratingly doesn't auto focus on the 2FA code entry box when logging in, this fixes that!
(Actually, it does, but a prompt to "enter your 2FA code" stupidly draws focus from the code box and to the prompt itself)

###Instructions
If anyone other than me ever wants to use this for some reason
1. Download this repo
2. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions/) in your browser
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click on "Load Unpacked Extension"
5. Select the top-level folder you downloaded from this repo (the one that contains manifest.json)
6. Nice, you did it
